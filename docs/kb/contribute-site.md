## Structure

The website is hosted using [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages){:target="_blank"} and built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. The files that make up the website are contained within the `docs` folder (as Github Pages requires) within the master branch. You'll find more details about how they are organized and their purpose below.

```
.
├── site                      > Contains MD files that need to go under the base website
│   └── **.md
├── kb                        > Contains MD files for the documentation section of the website
│   ├── img
│   │   └── **.png            > images required for documentation
│   └── **.md                 > All the MDs that make up the documentation
├── assets                    > Contains JS, CSS, IMGs for the site
│   ├── js
│   ├── img
│   └── css
├── index.html                > Website Landing page
├── README.md               *** You are here
├── _config.yml               > Site wide configuration and variables
└── Gemfile                   > Plugins required for the website to be built by Jekyll
```

In order for Jekyll to process the MD files and render them as html, you'll need to add the below to the beginning of the each MD file. 

```yaml
---
layout: resources             # choose between default, docs, page or resources
title: Additional Resources   # provide the title for the web page
description: Update this      # this shows up in the Website description
permalink: /resources         # this is the short link for the page, if empty the relative path of the md file is used
#other yaml data that can be referenced within the page
---
```

### Other Key Files and Folders

- **_functions:** folder that contains all the featured functions showcased on the landing page
- **_usecases:** folder that contains all the use cases showcased on the landing page

  - **docs** - use this for layout for the docs
  - **page** - use this for the pages that needs to go on the base site

## Run the website locally

To validate changes to any file/folder to the website, please verify them locally before you push to the repo.

### Pre-Reqs

- Install [Docker Client for your operating system](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Build and View Documentation

- **Step 1:** Change into the `docs` directory

- **Step 2:** Run the following command to start the [Jekyll Docker container image](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker/) and begin serving the documentation:

Linux/Mac

```console
docker run --rm \
  --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
  --publish 4000:4000 \
  jekyll/jekyll:3.8.6 \
  jekyll serve
```

Windows:

```powershell
docker run --rm `
  --volume="${PWD}:/srv/jekyll" `
  --publish 4000:4000 `
  jekyll/jekyll:3.8.6 `
  jekyll serve
```

> Note: You may seen a warning saying `Auto-regeneration may not work on some Windows versions.` Symptoms of this warning are the inability to automatically see any local website changes in your browser. This makes website changes difficult as you must restart Jekyll after every local change to view the results. To work around this issue, try the `--force-polling` switch to the `jekyll serve` command.

```console
docker run --rm `
  --volume="${PWD}:/srv/jekyll" `
  --publish 4000:4000 `
  jekyll/jekyll:3.8 `
  jekyll serve --force-polling
```

- **Step 3:** Once the server is ready, you can open a browser to `http://localhost:4000` to review the documentation locally. If you need to change the default port (`4000`), modify the `--publish` arguments from step 2.

```console
